# Fabric+Forge Example Mod

*...using [Architectury Loom](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom)* to create a Forge and Fabric mod using the same codebase by using a shared src/java and src/resources folder. This is probably far from the "best" solution, but it is *a* solution. By default mojmap will be used, but you can also use yarn.

Also note that this repo won't be constantly updated and still might contain one or the other issue that you might need to figure out on your own.

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the
IDE that you are using.

## License
